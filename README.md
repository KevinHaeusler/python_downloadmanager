# python_downloadmanager
A Python Script to manage completed Downloads.

You can clone this repository and change the script locations to your liking.

If you schedule this script to run as task in Windows 10 use the .pyw file.

##To do:
- Add more filetypes. Maybe implement RegEx.
- Change it to a service that runs when a file changes instead of scheduled task.
- Implement Errors and Exceptions (Try/Catch/Except)
- Could also try to create a function to move the files and write to log file.
